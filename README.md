# Android-SwissAppKnife

Because who doesn't need an app that:
* is a Calculator
* is a card flip matching game
* a music player for your files
* keeps an API ranking of your wins

#### Login/Register

Allows several users to register separately.

#### API

When the course ended, the API it used to connect to doesn't exist anymore so this needs to be updated.

#### Disclaimer

The idea for this app was based on the requirements given by the instructor at the end of the Android course I took to showcase several Android functionalities, hence the superficial randomness feel of it.

This app is by no means finished UX/UI wise until `Final Commit` is described. Some improvements to its code need to happen as well.
